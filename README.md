# System Analysis, Design, and Testing

This repository contains my work from **COMP 2147 – System Analysis, Design & Testing** at George Brown College.  
This course develops my analytical ability to translate business problems into structured system requirements and models.

Throughout the course, I learned to:
- Apply Object-Oriented System Analysis and Design methodology
- Use UML diagrams to visualize system behavior and data flows
- Gather, refine and document system requirements
- Build process models such as DFDs & use case diagrams
- Design logical and physical data models
- Plan interfaces, forms, reports, and usability-centered systems
- Evaluate testing strategies such as unit, integration & acceptance testing

### Topics Covered
- Systems Development Environment
- Origins of Software & SDLC
- Project Planning & Initiation
- Requirement Elicitation
- Process & Data Modelling
- Database Design
- Interface Design
- System Implementation & Maintenance

### Tools & Techniques
- Visual Paradigm® for UML and CASE modeling
- Rational Unified Process (RUP)
- UML: Use Case, Sequence, Activity, Class Diagrams
- Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)

### Relevance to Data Analytics

This course strengthened my ability to:
- understand business logic behind data
- map real-world processes into models
- analyze data requirements before building dashboards or queries
- think in systems rather than just writing code

This mindset is essential for Data Analysts who work with business requirements, data modeling, BI systems, and stakeholder communication.
